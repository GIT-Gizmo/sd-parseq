# Stable Diffusion Parseq

## What is this?

For context: 

* [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) is an AI image generation tool.
* [AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) is a UI for that tool.
* The [Deforum extension for Automatic1111](https://github.com/deforum-art/deforum-for-automatic1111-webui) is an extention for that UI, for creating AI animations.

Parseq is a _parameter sequencer_ for the [Deforum extension for Automatic1111](https://github.com/deforum-art/deforum-for-automatic1111-webui). You can use it to generate animations with tight control and flexible interpolation over many Stable Diffusion parameters (such as seed, scale, prompt weights, noise, image strength...), as well as input processing parameter (such as zoom, pan, 3D rotation...).

You can jump straight into the UI here: https://sd-parseq.web.app/ . 

For now Parseq is fully front-end and stores all state in browser local storage (there is no backend).

## What's new?

### Version 0.1.0

* Parseq script mode is now deprecated, and Deforum integration mode is the default. I will no longer develop the Parseq script for a1111, focussing instead on making Parseq play well with the Deforum extension for a1111. The Parseq script was destined to only ever be an inferior version of the Deforum extension. If you need to work with the legacy parseq script variables, you can try here: https://sd-parseq.web.app/legacy .
* New document management, peristed to local storage, with options to revert, share & import. Keyframe data is no longer stored in the URL (this caused issues on some browsers). 
* New editable graph! You can add and update keyframes directly on the graph.


## Installation

- Have a working installation of [Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
- Install the Deforum extension [from the parseq-integration branch of my fork of the Deforum integration](https://github.com/rewbs/deforum-for-automatic1111-webui/tree/parseq-integration). You might not be able to do it directly from the A1111 UI. Here's how to do it manually:
   - `git clone https://github.com/rewbs/deforum-for-automatic1111-webui.git`
   - `git checkout parseq-integration`
- Relaunch Auto1111 â€“ You should now see a `Parseq` section right at the bottom for the `keyframes` tab under the `Deforum` extension (click to expand it):

### Alternative: Parseq Script installation (deprecated)

This is a legacy step: Deforum is by far a more powerful animation back-end. Use this approach if you don't want to use Deforum for some reason, and would prefer to use Parseq's own back-end integration with A1111. 

- Have a working installation of [Automatic1111's Stable Diffusion UI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)
- [Install ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- Ensure A1111 can resolve the python library `ffmpeg-python`:
   - On Windows: edit `requirements_versions.txt` in the top level directory of A111, and add the line: `ffmpeg-python==0.2.0`.
   - On Mac/Linux: edit `requirements.txt` in the top level directory of A111, and add the line: `ffmpeg-python`.   
- From this repository, copy `scripts/parseq_script.py` and `scripts/parseq_core.py` to the `/scripts` subdirectory in your SD webui installation.
- Restart the webui (or do a full Gradio reload from the settings screen). You should now see `SD Parseq <version>` as a script available in the img2img section.


## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with this. Most of these were generated at 20fps then smoothed to 60fps with ffmpeg minterpolate.

- Img2img loopback using Deforum, with fluctiations on many parameters, and sync'ed to audio :

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74455/199890662-9f446def-0582-4021-8249-84ce6b7df5d7.mp4


- Vid2vid using the Parseq script backend, with fluctuations on many different params to attempt to synchronise param changes and image movement to music. The input audio is an excerpt of [The Prodigy - Smack My Bitch Up (Noisia Remix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5OgQCvqbYA), and the original input video was generated with [Butterchurn](https://butterchurnviz.com/). Includes a side-by-side comparison of the original input video, the "dry run" video (which includes all pre-processing but no Stable Diffusion), and the final output:

- Loopback using Deforum video where we oscillate between a few famous faces with some 3d movement and occasional denoising spikes to reset the context:

## Usage

### Step 1: Create your parameter manifest

* Go to https://sd-parseq.web.app/ (or run the UI yourself from this repo with `npm start`)
* Edit the table at the top to specify your keyframes and parameter values at those keyframes. See below for more information about what you can do here.
* Hit `Render` to generate the JSON config for every frame.
* Copy the contents of the textbox at the bottom

### Step 2: Generate the video

* Head to the SD web UI go to the Deforum tab and then the Keyframes tab.
* Paste the JSON you copied in step 1 into the Parseq section at the bottom of the page.
* Fiddle with any other Deforum / Stable Diffusion settings you want to tweak.
* Click generate.

## UI Features

### Intro to scriptable / keyframable parameter values

Parseq's main feature is advanced control over parameter values, using keyframing with interesting interpolation features.

The keyframe grid is the central concept in Parseq. Each row in the grid represents a keyframe. Each controllable parameter has a pair of columns: the first takes an explicit value for that field, and the second takes an _interpolation formula_, which defines how the value will "travel" to the next keyframe's value. If no interpolation formula is specified on a given keyframe, the same formula continues to be used.

A graph allows you to see the result of the interpolation (and edit keyframe values!):

The interpolation formula can be an arbitrarily complex mathematical expression, and can use a range of built-in functions and values, including oscillators and helpers to synchronise them to timestamps or beats:

#### Values

| value  	|  description 	| example  	| example output 	|
|---	    |---	|---	|---	|
| `S`   	| Step interpolation: use the last keyframed value 	|<img width="166" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74455/199902063-da5c054c-9572-4f63-aa26-1b6853b89ac9.png">| <img width="500" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74455/199902277-2009c100-08b1-487d-84d8-d0d5194df302.png"> |
| `L` 	  | (default) Linear interpolation betwen the last and next keyframed value |   	| |
| `C`  	| Cubic spline interpolation betwen the last and next keyframed value  	| <img width="194" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74455/199900924-7e709a58-fa6d-44cb-babe-acb3fe5e351e.png"> | <img width="500" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74455/199901099-7ee4a56a-9b56-4ce0-b403-6099c2d1f5c3.png"> |
| `P`  	| Polinomial interpolation betwen the last and next keyframed value  	|   	| |
| `f`  	| Frame number  	|   	| |
| `prev_keyframe`  	| Previous keyframe number for this column 	|   	| |
| `next_keyframe`  	| Next keyframe number for this column 	|   	| |
| `prev_keyframe_value`  	| Previous keyframed value for this column 	|   	| |
| `next_keyframe_value`  	| Next keyframed value for this column 	|   	| |

#### Functions

All functions can be called either with unnamed args (e.g. `sin(10)`) or named args (e.g. `sin(period=10, amplitude=2)`). Most arguments have long and short names.

| function  	|  description 	| example  	|
|---	    |---	|---	|
| `sin()`   	| Sine wave oscillator 	|   	|
| `sq()` 	  | Square wave oscillator |   	|
| `tri()`  	| Triangle wave oscillator  	|   	|
| `saw()`  	| Sawtooth wave oscillator  	|   	|
| `pulse()`  	| Pulse wave oscillator  	|   	|
| `bez()`  	| Return a point on a Bezier curve between previous and next keyframe. Arguments are the same as https://cubic-bezier.com/ . If none specified, defaults to `bez(0.5,0,0.5,1)`  	|   	|
| `min()`  	| Return the minimum of 2 argument  	|   	|
| `max()`  	| Return the maximum of 2 argument  	|   	|
| `abs()`  	| Return the asolute value of the argument |   	|
| `round()`  	| Return the rounded value of the argument |   	|

#### Units

Units can be used to modify numbers representing frame ranges to match second of beat offsets calculated using the FPS and BPM values. This is particularly useful when specifying the period of an oscillator.

| unit  	|  description 	| example  	|
|---	    |---	|---	|
| `f`   	| (default) frames 	|   	|
| `s` 	  | seconds |   	|
| `b`  	| beats  	|   	|

#### Other operators and expressions:



| if expression  	|  description 	| example  	|
|---	    |---	|---	|
| `if <cond> <consequent> else <alt>`   	| 	|   	|

| operator  	|  description 	| example  	|
|---	    |---	|---	|
| `+`   	| 	|   	|
| `-` 	  | |   	|
| `*`  	|   	|   	|
| `/`  	|   	|   	|

## Credits

This script includes ideas and code sourced from many other scripts. Thanks in particular to the following sources of inspiration:

* Everyone behind Deforum: https://github.com/deforum-art/
* Filarus for their vid2vid script: https://github.com/Filarius/stable-diffusion-webui/blob/master/scripts/vid2vid.py .  
* Animator-Anon for their animation script: https://github.com/Animator-Anon/Animator/blob/main/animation.py . I picked up some good ideas from this.
* Yownas for their seed travelling script: https://github.com/yownas/seed_travel . sd-parsec can only travel between consecutive seeds so only offers a fraction of the possible seed variations that Yownas's script does.
* feffy380 for the prompt-morph script https://github.com/feffy380/prompt-morph
* eborboihuc for the clear implementation of 3d rotations using `cv2.warpPerspective()`:  https://github.com/eborboihuc/rotate_3d/blob/master/image_transformer.py
